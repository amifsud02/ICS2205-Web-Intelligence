      "The First American to walk in Space – Edward White.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward White during Gemini 4 performing EVA.  On June, 3, 1965, Edward Higgins White becomes the first American to “walk” in space in the course of the Gemini 4 space mission. White is one of the three U.S. astronauts, who died along with his fellow astronauts Virgil “Gus” Grissom and Roger B. Chaffee during prelaunch testing for the first manned Apollo mission at Cape Canaveral. Edward White earned his Bachelor degree at the U.S. Military Academy and he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Air Force. After he had some experience in flight, he spent over three years in West Germany flying in the defense of NATO. White’s education in aeronautical engineering began in 1958 at the University of Michigan and he was appointed test pilot shortly after, gaining over 3000 flight hours with the Air Force. Project Gemini 4 became the very first multi-day space flight by the United States. The main objective was to show that it was possible for humans to remain in space for extended lengths of time. However, the four day orbit flight could not break the five day record set by the Soviet Vostok 5 two years before. Another main goal of the operation was the first American extra-vehicular activity (EVA), also known as “space walk“. The first human space walk of all times was performed by Soviet Alexei Leonov on Voskhod 2 in March 1965. However, this second objective was not officially decided until a day or two before the launch, as newspapers recorded. The attempt of the first space rendezvous was the third goal. Gemini 4 would attempt to fly in formation with the spent second stage of its Titan II launch vehicle, which unfortunately, was unsuccessful. For the first time, the launch of a spacecraft became a huge media event. An international audience from 12 European nations, could watch the lift-off on live television via the Early Bird satellite. Press interest, due to the satellite broadcast and the new center in Houston, proved to be so high that NASA had to lease buildings to accommodate the 1.100 print and broadcast journalists who requested accreditation. Edward White was chosen as Pilot of Gemini 4 along with Command Pilot James McDevitt. On June 3, 1965, White was finally able to make his first “steps” into space. Tied to a tether, White floated out of the spacecraft, using a hand held maneuvering unit. He floated away about five meters before experimenting with the maneuvering device while McDevitt took pictures. However, mission control feared that the pilots would cross the solar terminator and communication turned out to be increasingly difficult. As they did not want the space walk to be performed in the darkness, they decided that White had to go back in the spaceship. First, White did not want to return to the spaceship, because he enjoyed his experience so much. He tried to excuse his longer space walk with taking more pictures and McDevitt finally managed to coax him in. White replied: “I’m coming back in… and it’s the saddest moment of my life“. Eventually, the pilot returned to the ship and just at this moment, they entered darkness. Even though the re-entry and landing was rough, the pilots returned to Earth safely and were recovered by an American ship as they landed in the ocean. After the Gemini mission, Edward White was named the astronaut specialist for the flight control systems of the Apollo Command/Service Module. In 1966, he was selected as Senior Pilot for the first manned Apollo flight. The mission was then named Apollo 1. During a test of the spacecraft, which included a rehearsal of the launch countdown procedure, a fire broke out in the pure oxygen-filled cabin, killing all three pilots. Edward White passed away on January 27, 1967. At yovisto, you may be interested in a video showing the actual space walk of Edward White.\n",

      "Carnot and Thermodynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot (1796-1832).  On June 1, 1796, French military engineer and physicist Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot was born. He is often described as the “father of thermodynamics“. In particular, Carnot gave the first successful theory of the maximum efficiency of heat engines. Carnot’s work attracted little attention during his lifetime, but it was later used by Rudolf Clausius and Lord Kelvin to formalize the second law of thermodynamics and define the concept of entropy. Sadi Carnot was the eldest son of Lazare Carnot and he was born in the Palais du Petit-Luxembourg. At the time of Sadi’s birth, his father was an eminent mathematician, military engineer, and a member of the Directory, the French Revolutionary government which lasted four years from November 1795 to November 1799. Sadi was named after a medieval Persian poet and philosopher called Sa’di of Shiraz. It was a time of unrest and political turmoil in France and, due the position of his father, whose fortunes changed dramatically many times, he was brought up in a totally unstable environment of interacting politics and science. At the age of 16, Sadi Carnot became a cadet in the École Polytechnique in Paris, which was intended to train engineers for military service, but its professors included such eminent scientists as André-Marie Ampère, François Arago, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, and Siméon Denis Poisson. After graduating in 1814, Sadi became an officer in the French army’s corps of engineers. Because his father Lazare had served as Napoleon’s minister of the interior during the “Hundred Days“, he was forced into exile after Napoleon’s final defeat in 1815. Therefore, also Sadi’s position in the army under the restored Bourbon monarchy of Louis XVIII became increasingly difficult. In 1819, Sadi transferred to the newly formed General Staff, in Paris. He remained on call for military duty, but from then on he dedicated most of his attention to private intellectual pursuits. He befriended the scientist Nicolas Clément and attended lectures on physics and chemistry. More and more, he became interested in understanding the limitation to improving the performance of steam engines, which led him to the investigations that became his Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, published in 1824, considered the founding work of thermodynamics. Steam engines had achieved widely recognized economic and industrial importance, but there had been no real scientific study of them. Although there existed some intuitive understanding of the workings of engines, scientific theory for their operation was almost nonexistent. In 1824 the principle of conservation of energy was still poorly developed and controversial, and an exact formulation of the first law of thermodynamics was still more than a decade away; the mechanical equivalence of heat would not be formulated for another two decades. In his main work Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire Carnot sought to answer two questions about the operation of heat engines: “Is the work available from a heat source potentially unbounded?” and “Can heat engines in principle be improved by replacing the steam with some other working fluid or gas?” The book was plainly intended to cover a rather wide range of topics about heat engines in a rather popular fashion, the most important part of the book was devoted to an abstract presentation of an idealized engine that could be used to understand and clarify the fundamental principles that are generally applied to all heat engines, independent of their design. This resulted in a model thermodynamic system upon which exact calculations could be made. By idealizing the engine, he could arrive at clear and indisputable answers to his original two questions. In Carnot’s idealized model, the caloric transported from a hot to a cold body, yielding work, could be transported back by reversing the motion of the cycle, a concept subsequently known as thermodynamic reversibility. Carnot retired from the army in 1828, without a pension. He was interned in a private asylum in 1832 as suffering from “mania” and “general delirum”. He died during a cholera epidemic in 1832, at the age of only 36. Because of the contagious nature of cholera, many of Carnot’s belongings and writings were buried together with him after his death. As consequence, only a handful of his scientific writings survived. It is likely that Carnot would have made many more significant scientific contributions had his life not been so tragically short. His work was only taken seriously after his early death. Emile Clapeyron, a fellow student from Ecole Polytechnique translated Carnot’s book into mathematical terms and more than a decade later Rudolf Clausius and Lord Kelvin extended Carnot’s work into what is present day thermodynamics. At yovisto you might learn more about the principles behind steam engines and thermodynamics in the lecture videos of Prof. Ranamurti Shankar from Yale on ‘Fundamentals of Physics‘, where he also discusses the laws of thermodynamics.\n",

      "Ulugh Beg – Astronomer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ulugh Beg Image: Obaidullah.abrar.  On March 22, 1394, Mongolian astronomer, mathematician and sultan Mīrzā Muhammad Tāraghay bin Shāhrukh, better known as Ulugh Beg was (probably) born. Although the only important Mongol scientist, he was the greatest astronomer of his time. Pursuing this interest he built an observatory at Samarkand. In his observations he discovered a number of errors in the computations of the 2nd-century Alexandrian astronomer Ptolemy, whose figures were still being used. Ulugh Beg was the grandson of the conqueror Timur. After Timur’s death, the empire was disputed among his sons including Skah Rukh, Ulugh Beg’s father. Starting from 1407, he controlled a great part of the empire including Iran and Turkistan regaining control of Samarkand. Two years later, Shah Rukh decided to make Herat in Khorasan his new capital and made it a center of trade and culture while Samarkand was given to Ulugh Beg, who was highly interested in making the city a cultural centre instead of dealing with politics and the military. [1,3] It is believed that already in his early years, Ulugh Beg was interested in science, especially astronomy. He visited the remains of Maragha Observatory in his younger years. [2] However, Ulugh Beg also never neglected the arts, writing poetry himself and studying history. He built a center for higher education, especially mathematics, which was completed in 1420. Ulugh Beg began to appoint the best scientists he could find to positions there as lecturers. [1,2] Al-Kashi became one of the leading figures of the scientific life of Samarkand and in his letters, he praised the mathematical achievements of Ulugh Beg, who led scientific meetings where problems in astronomy were freely discussed. [1] Soon, Ulugh Beg started to built an astronomy at Samarkand and the construnction works probably began in 1428. The observatory was over 35 meters high and 50 meters in diameter. [1,2] The scientists working at the observatory were able to find methods for giving accurate approximate solutions of cubic equations and work with the binomial theorem. Also, Ulugh Beg’s accurate tables of sines and tangents correct to eight decimal places were established and formulae of spherical trigonometry were found. Further, Ulugh Beg’s Catalogue of the stars, the first comprehensive stellar catalogue since that of Ptolemy counts to one of their greatest achievements. [1] The star catalogue, the Zij-i Sultani, was published in 1437 and gives the positions of almost 1000 stars. The catalogue was accomplished by Ulugh Beg himself, al-Kashi, and Qadi Zada. The work contained tables of observations made at the Observatory, calendar calculations and results in trigonometry. Further, several mistakes in the calculations of Ptolemy were found and with the help of the new findings, Ulugh Beg was able to calculate the length of the year as 365 days 5 hours 49 minutes 15 seconds. [1,2] Unfortunately, after the death of Ulugh Beg’s father in 1447, he could not retain power and was put to death. In 1941, his tomb was discovered in the mausoleum built by Timur in Samarkand.
